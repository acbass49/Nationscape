# Nationscape
I have done two posts about Latter-day Saints using Nationscape. The code of the analysis and figures for both is in this repository:

1. In 2020, I did a [political analysis of Latter-day Saints](https://alexbass.me/posts/lds_gop/). The code for this post is found in ./scripts/political_analysis.R.
2. In 2023, I did an [analysis of Latter-day Saint income over time](https://alexbass.me/posts/income_myth/). The code for this post is found in ./scripts/Income_Myth.R.

Here is where I got all of the Nationscape data: https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/nationscape-data-set

Here is where my table I created is located:https://rpubs.com/acbass49/701955

# Future Analysis:::
