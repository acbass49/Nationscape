# Nationscape
LDS population political analysis using nationscape

Here is my rscript I used for everything. In the future, I want to break this up into these smaller chunks:
1. Combine data
2. Analysis and variable creation
3. Figures 1-5

In this file, I might also include an analysis on how Utah Latter-day Saints differ from NOT Utah Latter-day Saints.

Here is where I got all of the Nationscape data: https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/nationscape-data-set

Here is where my table I created is located:https://rpubs.com/acbass49/701955
